# Name: Yuan Chen
# Description: This program reads motifs from motifs.txt and searches for their occurrences in protein sequences from human_aa_chr2_partial.txt. 
# For each motif, it creates an output file and writes the sequences containing the motif. 
# It also prints the number of occurrences of each motif and the number of sequences containing it.
